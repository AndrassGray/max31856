Possible replacements are
1. changing to a different chip (see below)
2. using a MAX31855S, a S-type version of the more reliable '55 chip
3. using a MAX31855K and translate temperatures: https://forum.arduino.cc/t/something-wrong-with-thermocouple/296117/3
4. go for a high‑resolution delta‑sigma ADC (e.g. MAX11200/ADS1248)
